# Discover tereus

Tereus is a code transpiling service that converts your code from one language to another.

We currently support two language pairs:

- [C to Go](category/c-to-go/)
- [Lua to Ruby](category/lua-to-ruby/) (still a work in progress)

To get started with Tereus, launch the [app](https://tereus.dev) and start transpiling!
